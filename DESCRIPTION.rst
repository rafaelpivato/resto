Resto Python Microframework
===========================


Overview
--------

Along the last years, coding in  Python was fun enough to realize that
the amount  of freedom provided by  the platform could be  way to much
sometimes, specially while working with  a bigger team or thousands of
lines.

This is based on a peculiar  `iron triangle idea`_ where the excess of
flexibility would cause harmful effects to a code base. This is one of
main motivations behind what you can think as lack of functionality in
this project.


Out of Scope
------------

This project  avoids falling into  a deep  REST discussion; of  a kind
that `Roy  Fielding`_ would care about.  Main concern is to  provide a
useful framework for companies and start ups willing to increase their
development speed by enforcing some  minimum quality at their Web REST
back-ends.
