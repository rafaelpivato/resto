Resto Python Microframework
===========================


Overview
--------

Along the last years, coding in Python was fun enough to realize that the
amount of freedom provided by the platform could be way to much sometimes,
specially while working with a bigger team or thousands of lines.

This is based on a peculiar `iron triangle idea`_ where the excess of
flexibility woul cause harmful effects to a code base. This is one of main
motivations behind what you can think as lack of functionality in this project.


Out of Scope
------------

This project avoids falling into a deep REST discussion; of a kind that
`Roy Fielding`_ would care about. Main concern is to provide a useful framework
for companies and start ups willing to increase their development speed by
enforcing some minumum quality at their Web REST back-ends.
